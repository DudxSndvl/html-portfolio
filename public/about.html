<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I’m Ardee, an aspiring Full Stack Web Developer passionate about building responsive,
  user-friendly, and efficient web applications. I’m currently learning the full stack development 
  process, focusing on technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, and databases.</p>

<p>I enjoy solving problems, creating intuitive user experiences, 
  and continuously improving my skills to deliver scalable and modern web solutions. 
  My goal is to grow into a versatile developer who can handle both front-end and back-end 
  challenges while keeping up with emerging technologies and best practices.</p>

<p>When I’m not coding, I love exploring new ideas, learning new skills, 
  and finding ways to turn concepts into real, working projects.</p>
